Shell script created by Markus Ulfberg 2013-03-07

Runs desired $ACTION when $FILE is present in $DIR
For instance when a USB stick containing the file "systemHaltNow" is found 
in "/media/usb-shutdown" the script executes "/sbin/shutdown -h now"

I created this as way to make an old laptop converted into a digital picture 
frame shut down nicely without having to connect a keyboard. 
For this I have roots cron-daemon running the script every minute. 
Other uses could be to show pictures on an inserted USB stick etc.
